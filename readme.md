IRIS DATASET

Introduced by Ronald Fisher in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems", it includes three iris species with 50 samples each and also some properties about each flower.(1)

The three classes in the data set are the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolor and the Iris Virginica.(1)

The attributes described in the dataset are: 
1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica.(2)

Based on these attributes, Fisher developed a linear discriminant analysis where the species can be differenciated from each other.(1)(2)

For this project:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate
